This is the collection of exercises from the course Stochastic Optimisation Algorithms (FIM711) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. 
The course is a part of the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) program.  

Purpose: The aim of the course is for the students to attain an understanding of methods in computer science that are inspired by natural processes such as evolution and cooperative behavior (for example, swarming), and also to be able to apply such methods in many different kinds of optimization problems. The methods studied in the course are relevant both in technical applications, for example in the optimization and design of autonomous systems, and for understanding biological systems, for example through simulation of evolutionary processes.
